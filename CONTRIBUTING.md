Contributing
============

Contributions from members outside of the organization should always be made via pull requests. The repo contains a [pull request template](https://github.com/azbrscca/azbrscca.org/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to be completed by the submitter. Only members of the AZBR organization on GitHub can approve and merge pull requests.

If you find a problem on the web site, please feel free to file an [issue](https://github.com/azbrscca/azbrscca.org/issues) with a description of the problem. Referencing issues when submitted pull requests is strongly encouraged.
