                The Sports Car Club of America is represented in the Tucson and southern Arizona area
                by the Arizona Border Region, region #88, which is part of the larger SCCA Southern
                Pacific Division. The Arizona Border region's primary activity is Solo events, more
                commonly referred to as autocross. We also sanction rallycross events in conjuntion
                with Arizona Rally Group and host regional road rally events. Monthly board meetings
                are open to anyone and are typically the first Tuesday of every month.
              </p>
              <p>
                Competition is not limited to SCCA members as the organization offers a weekend/temporary
                membership for those who would like to compete but who have not yet joined the SCCA. All
                that is required to participate is a driver's license, a nominally safe car that can pass
                a straightfoward tech inspection, and a helmet (loaners are available at no cost). Event
                registration fees are discounted for SCCA members and for those that pre-register online.
              </p>
