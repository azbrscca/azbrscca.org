                Born in 2013, the <strong><em>Two Days Of Awesome</em></strong> is a weekend long,
                national tour style throwdown in which autocrossers from all over Arizona -
                and sometimes New Mexico, California, and Texas - descend upon a regional airport
                northwest of Tucson to see just how awesome they really are.

              </p>
              <p>
                For the third year running, the Border Region will be running a two day, national tour style
                event to welcome fall to the Old Pueblo (just don't mind the temps in the 90s...). Both days are
                open and welcome to anyone at any autox skill level. In fact, there might not be a
                better introduction to the sport than seat time on back to back days!
              </p>
              <p>
                The Saturday event does not count towards any AZBR series, only the Two Days of Awesome. The Sunday event counts towards the Fall 2016 series. Cumulative results for the weekend <em>Awesome Series</em> are made available online. Entrants can sign up for one or both days and we offer a $10 discount for entrants that are registered and paid for both days by the close of on site registration on Saturday. To get the discount you can pay via Paypal prior to the close of online registration or by check or cash at the registration table on Saturday.
              </p>
              <!-- 
              <p>
                <strong>Saturday post-event</strong> we will be gathering at <strong>Texas Roadhose restaurant (8450 N Cracker Barrel Rd Marana, AZ 85743-8581</strong>) for dinner and drinks. All are welcome, however food and drinks are not provided or paid for by the club.

              <h3 class="text-info text-center">Event Information</h3>

              <p>
                The following information pertain to Two Days of Awesome events held
                at Marana Regional Airport. This information is in addition to the
                <a href="<?php echo baseHref;?>autocross/supplimental.html">
                  autocross supplemental regulations
                </a>
                and the
                <a href="<?php echo baseHref;?>autocross/details.html">
                  site regulations
                </a>
                that cover all AZBR Solo events at Marana Regional Airport.
              </p>
            
              <h4><strong>Junior Karts</strong></h4>
              <p>
                Junior Karts are permitted at this event provided a Youth Solo Safety Steward is provided (you bring your own).
                Arrangements must be made in advance of the event by contacting
                AZBR Regional Executive <a href="email:re@azbrscca.org">Dave Rock</a> or
                AZBR Solo Director <a href="email:solodirector@azbrscca.org">Rob Rockefeller</a>.
              </p>
                
              <h4><strong>SCCA Waiver</strong></h4>
              <p>
                The SCCA waiver is good for both days. If you attend Saturday then just keep your wrist
                band on and show it at the gate. If you remove the wrist band then you will be required to
                sign the waiver on Sunday.
              </p>
                
              <h4><strong>Tech Inspection</strong></h4>
              <p>
                Tech inspection only needs to be performed once for this two day event.
                If done on Saturday it will not be required for Sunday.
                Exceptions are entrants making significant changes to their cars
                between Saturday and Sunday. Use sound judgment, avoid safety issues,
                and re-tech if needed;
                the line on Sunday is usually very short since many people tech Saturday.
              </p>
                
              <h4><strong>Site Information</strong></h4>
              <p>
                Bring appropriate drinks for all day hydration. Six 12 or 16 ounce water bottles or sport
                drinks are usually adequate. Although the club provides drinking water on site, it is intended
                for course workers or as a backup for those that forget to bring drinks or run out.
              </p>
                
              <p>
                No alcohol is permitted to be consumed on the event site. This is anywhere inside the outer
                most gate at Avara Valley Road.
              </p>
                
              <p>No barbeques can be used on site.</p>
                
              <p>
                There will be no access to the event site on Friday. Gates will open on Saturday at 7:00am for participants per the normal <a href="<?php echo baseHref; ?>/autocross/calendar.html">event schedule</a>. See camping rule below for local RV/trailer option.
              </p>
                
              <p>
                Overnight parking of cars and trailers is permitted on site. They must be located in the dirt/gravel area
                between the event pavement and the inner fence. The site will be locked over night with no access from the time
                the event ends and clean up is completed on Saturday afternoon until Sunday morning at 7:00 AM.
                This site is an active airport and the pavement area must be cleared over night to allow use for emergencies.
              </p>
                
              <p>
                No onsite camping is permitted. "On site" meaning the area where the event is taking place.
                There is a location available near the main entrance to the airport that people have used before.
                This is not a reserved area for overnight parking so park at your own discretion.
                See highlighted area below. The airport cafe, also near the entrance, opens at 6:00 AM, has good food,
                and is fast to serve.
