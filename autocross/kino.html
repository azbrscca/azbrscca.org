                    Coming from the northwest, take I-10 East to exit 263B, "Kino Pkwy N." After exiting the freeway,
                    take the next right turn, following the sign to "Phoenix / Ajo Way." At the next traffic light,
                    turn left to go East on Ajo Way.

                Travel East on Ajo Way for about a mile, until you reach the traffic light at Country Club Road. Turn right
                and drive about half a mile, then turn right onto Milber Street. The waiver station is at the entrance to
                paddock, which is on the left about a quarter mile down the street.

                  Please adhere to the above routing and only enter/exit the site from the intersection of Country Club and Milber. This keeps our

              <p>
                Take extra precautions to ensure the site is kept safe, clean and not damaged in any way.
                We need to build a positive relationship with the sports complex so we can continue use of the site.
                Remind others around you if they appear to have forgotten the rules. There will be a number
                of garbage cans located near the paddock, grid, and trailer. Please use them. AZBR will provide
                12"x12" boards for use with jacks and jack stands. They must be used to prevent damage to the
                pavement.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  No glass containers are permitted onsite.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No animals or pets are allowed. Service animals that provide specific ADA qualifying assistance are allowed,
                  unfortunately emotional support animals do not qualify for this.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Strictly follow all posted speed limits. Milber St and other streets internal to the complex
                  are 25MPH or lower. Once in paddock, the speed limit is 10MPH.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Boards shall be used under jacks and jack stands to prevent damage to the pavement.
                  AZBR will provide the boards and they will be located near the paddock area. Ask if
                  you cannot find them. Please return them when finished so they can be used at future events.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All participants and spectators shall remain in the autocross site area (paddock and course), as this
                  is the only part of the sports complex we have rented. If you see a closed gate anywhere, do not attempt
                  to open it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Site entry time for participants is <a href="<?php echo baseHref; ?>autocross/calendar.html">listed
                  on the event calendar for each event</a>. If you show up before the listed time please wait
                  outside the black fence as we will be setting up the paddock and other required boundaries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Participating cars and tow vehicles shall be parked in the paddock area as indicated on the
                  course/site map. Park on the pavement only. Do not park on the dirt.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At each event, an event meeting (mandatory for all drivers and spectators) will be held at the time
                  <a href="<?php echo baseHref;?>events/calendar.php">indicated on the event calendar</a>.
                  If more time is needed for setup/course walking we can move this out as required.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fluids leaked onto the pavement will NOT be tolerated. Water (i.e. air conditioner condensation)
                  is acceptable. If your car leaks any oil or other fluids you will not be allowed to run. Either
                  fix the leak before the event or do not participate. You can get a refund if desired up to 24
                  hours before the event. If your car leaks when you show up on the site you will not be allowed
                  to run. The exception to this is a breakage that occurs while participating in the event. If
                  the leak can be repaired quickly off the pavement then continuing to run may be allowed. We
                  do understand that things can go wrong while running your car.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No filling of fluids-including but not limited to fuel, oil, and coolant-on any asphalt
                  surface. As with the previous item, this is to prevent damage to the pavement. It is
                  absolutely imperative that we do our best to maintain the surface if we are going to
                  continue to enjoy the privilege of using it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cars entered for competition shall remain on the paved area once entered until ready to
                  leave the site. This is to minimize dirt and debris that could be transferred from unpaved
                  areas by sticky tires.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If your car is really loud, i.e. does not fit within the SCCA rules of 100db,
                  then put a muffler on. If you have to question whether your car loudness is close
                  to the limit, then put the muffler on.
                </li>
                <li>
                  One (1) portable toilet will be provided (rented by AZBR). Please keep it clean.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any loose trash left after the event is extremely dangerous to our future use
                  of the site. Contain your own trash and pick up anything you see. There will be a few
                  garbage cans on site. Use those or take trash off site when you leave.
                </li>
