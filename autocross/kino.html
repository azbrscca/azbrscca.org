              <p>
                The primary gate is used to access the site for most regional events.
                Travelling West on Avra Valley Rd from I-10, you will cross a canal with 100ft long concrete walls on both 
                sides of the road. 400 feet past the canal, you will turn right onto a paved road.
                Follow the paved road all the way around to the North end of the 
                site, where you will find the entrance gate and waiver station.

                  Failure to comply with site regulations can result in you
                  being asked to leave the event without a refund.
                </strong>
              </div>

              <p>
                Take extra precautions to ensure the site is kept safe, clean and not damaged in any way.
                We need to build a positive relationship with the airport so we can continue use of the site.
                Remind others around you if they appear to have forgotten the rules. There will be a number
                of garbage cans located near the paddock, grid, and trailer. Please use them. AZBR will provide
                12"x12" boards for use with jacks and jack stands. They must be used to prevent damage to the
                pavement.

                  Site entry for participants is <a href="<?php echo baseHref; ?>autoross/calendar.php">listed
                  on the event calendar for each event</a>. If you show up before the listed time please wait
                  outside the black fence as we will be setting up the paddock and other required boundaries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Participating cars and tow vehicles shall be parked in the paddock area as indicated on the
                  course/site map. Park on the pavement only. Do not park on the dirt.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At each event, a mandatory drivers meeting will be held at the time
                  <a href="<?php echo baseHref;?>events/calendar.php">indicated on the event calendar</a>.
                  If more time is needed for setup/course walking we can move this out as required.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Beech Starship aircraft located on the site are off limits. Do not visit them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All participants and spectators shall remain in the autocross site area. This is
                  defined by the lighter pavement area (uncoated) and can be seen on the overview map
                  as the largest yellow rectangle. The aircraft taxi ways on the west and north edges are
                  off limits. They are coated and appear darker.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Boards shall be used under jacks and jack stands to prevent damage to the pavement.
                  AZBR will provide the boards and they will be located near the paddock area. Ask if
                  you cannot find them. Please return them when finished so they can be used at future events.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fluids leaked onto the pavement will NOT be tolerated. Water (i.e. air conditioner condensation)
                  is acceptable. If your car leaks any oil or other fluids you will not be allowed to run. Either
                  fix the leak before the event or do not participate. You can get a refund if desired up to 24
                  hours before the event. If your car leaks when you show up on the site you will not be allowed
                  to run. The exception to this is a breakage that occurs while participating in the event. If
                  the leak can be repaired quickly off the pavement then continuing to run may be allowed. We
                  do understand that things can go wrong while running your car.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No filling of fluids-including but not limited to fuel, oil, and coolant-on any asphalt
                  surface. As with the previous item, this is to prevent damage to the pavement. It is
                  absolutely imperative that we do our best to maintain the surface if we are going to
                  continue to enjoy the privilege of using it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cars entered for competition shall remain on the paved area once entered until ready to
                  leave the site. This is to minimize dirt and debris that could be transferred from unpaved
                  areas by sticky tires.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If your car is really loud, i.e. does not fit within the SCCA rules of 100db,
                  then put a muffler on. If you have to question whether your car loudness is close
                  to the limit, then put the muffler on.
                </li>
                <li>One (1) portable toilet will be provided (rented by AZBR). Please keep it clean.</li>
                <li>
                  The site is an active airport and any FOD (Foreign Object Debris), from a Kleenex to a
                  water bottle, is extremely dangerous to the operating aircraft and to our future use
                  of the site. Contain your own trash and pick up anything you see. There will be a few
                  garbage cans on site. Use those or take trash off site when you leave.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If an aircraft taxis on the either of the two taxi ways immediately adjacent to the course,
                  the event will be stopped until the aircraft is clear of the area. If you are in the middle
                  of a run you will get a re-run. This is not a likely scenario, but be prepared in case it
                  happens.
