                Take extra precautions to ensure the site is kept safe, clean and not damaged in any way.
                We need to build a positive relationship with Musselman so we can continue use of the site.
                Remind others around you if they appear to have forgotten the rules. There will be a number
                of garbage cans located near the paddock, grid, and trailer. Please use them. AZBR will provide
                12"x12" boards for use with jacks and jack stands. This site has a lot of gravel and dirt in
                the parking area, please use the boards in those area for safety and on pavement to prevent
                damage to pavement.
              </p>
              <ol>

                  Site entry for participants is <a href="<?php echo baseHref; ?>autoross/calendar.php">listed
                  on the event calendar for each event</a>. If you show up before the listed time, please wait
                  in the gravel area outside the gate but do not block entrance to the gate as we will be setting
                  up the paddock and other required boundaries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Participating cars and tow vehicles shall be parked in the paddock area as indicated on the
                  course/site map.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At each event, a mandatory drivers meeting will be held at the time
                  <a href="<?php echo baseHref;?>events/calendar.php">indicated on the event calendar</a>.
                  If more time is needed for setup/course walking we can move this out as required.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All participants and spectators shall remain in the autocross site area. Please do not wander out
                  into the desert or into the track area during competition.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Boards shall be used under jacks and jack stands to prevent damage to the pavement and to provide a
                  safe point to put jack stand or jacks onto due to the dirt and gravel. AZBR will provide the boards
                  and they will be located near the paddock area. Ask if you cannot find them. Please return them when
                  finished so they can be used at future events.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fluids leaked onto the pavement will NOT be tolerated. Water (i.e. air conditioner condensation) is
                  acceptable. If your car leaks any oil or other fluids, you will not be allowed to run. Either fix the
                  leak before the event or do not participate. You can get a refund if desired up to 24 hours before
                  the event. If your car leaks when you show up on the site, you will not be allowed to run. The
                  exception to this is a breakage that occurs while participating in the event. If the leak can be
                  repaired quickly off the pavement then continuing to run may be allowed. We do understand that things
                  can go wrong while running your car.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Grid will be run a bit different at this location and will typically be placed on the track surface.
                  There is limited ability to enter and leave grid once a heat has been started. Grid will be a moving
                  grid instead of the stationary grid, so once your line of grid cars starts moving you should be ready
                  to run. Two Drivers cars will have their own line.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No filling of fluids-including but not limited to fuel, oil, and coolant-on any asphalt
                  surface. As with the previous item, this is to prevent damage to the pavement. It is
                  absolutely imperative that we do our best to maintain the surface if we are going to
                  continue to enjoy the privilege of using it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cars entered for competition shall minimize entering/leaving the paved grid area. This is to minimize
                  dirt and debris that could be transferred from unpaved areas by sticky tires. This event is being
                  held on a track and with that there are additional constraints to the event. If you get two wheels
                  off the track into the dirt it will be considered a DNF for that run. Four wheels off into the dirt
                  means you are done for the day.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If your car is really loud, i.e. does not fit within the SCCA rules of 100db,
                  then put a muffler on. If you have to question whether your car loudness is close
                  to the limit, then put the muffler on.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sites are hard to come by, and it is critical we keep this site clean. 
                  Any trash left behind is extremely dangerous to our future use of the site. 
                  Contain your own trash and pick up anything you see. There will be a few
                  garbage cans on site. Use those or take trash off site when you leave.
