                Take extra precautions to ensure the site is kept safe, clean and not damaged in any way.
                We need to build a positive relationship with Musselman so we can continue use of the site.
                Remind others around you if they appear to have forgotten the rules. There will be a number
                of garbage cans located near the paddock, grid, and trailer. Please use them. AZBR will provide
                12"x12" boards for use with jacks and jack stands. They must be used to prevent damage to the
                pavement. ::TODO: Still need boards for jacks and stands?::

                  AZBR will provide the boards and they will be located near the paddock area. Ask if
                  you cannot find them. Please return them when finished so they can be used at future events.

                  Fluids leaked onto the pavement will NOT be tolerated. Water (i.e. air conditioner condensation)
                  is acceptable. If your car leaks any oil or other fluids you will not be allowed to run. Either
                  fix the leak before the event or do not participate. You can get a refund if desired up to 24
                  hours before the event. If your car leaks when you show up on the site you will not be allowed
                  to run. The exception to this is a breakage that occurs while participating in the event. If
                  the leak can be repaired quickly off the pavement then continuing to run may be allowed. We
                  do understand that things can go wrong while running your car. ::TODO: eliminate?::

                  No filling of fluids-including but not limited to fuel, oil, and coolant-on any asphalt
                  surface. As with the previous item, this is to prevent damage to the pavement. It is
                  absolutely imperative that we do our best to maintain the surface if we are going to
                  continue to enjoy the privilege of using it. ::TODO: eliminate?::

                  Cars entered for competition shall minimize entering/leaving the paved grid area. 
                  This is to minimize dirt and debris that could be transferred from unpaved
                  areas by sticky tires. ::TODO: expand or reword or eliminate this?::

                  If your car is really loud, i.e. does not fit within the SCCA rules of 100db,
                  then put a muffler on. If you have to question whether your car loudness is close
                  to the limit, then put the muffler on.

                  Sites are hard to come by, and it is critical we keep this site clean. 
                  Any trash left behind is extremely dangerous to our future use of the site. 
                  Contain your own trash and pick up anything you see. There will be a few
                  garbage cans on site. Use those or take trash off site when you leave.
