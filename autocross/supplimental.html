                The regulations below apply to all events held by the Arizona Border Region SCCA
                in addition to the rules specified in the official SCCA Rule Book. 
              </h5>

              <h4><strong>Waiver of Liability</strong></h4>
              <p>
                Everyone entering the property on which the event is held must sign the SCCA Release
                and Waiver of Liability form and wear the provided wristband in an easily visible location on their 
                person, not on their vehicle,
              </p>
              <p class="text-danger">
                Anyone refusing to sign the waiver will be asked to leave the event site.
              </p>

              <h4><strong>Driver Registration</strong></h4>
              <p>
                All drivers must report to the registration table during the morning registration time.
                Each driver must present his or her valid driver's license upon registering and paying for their
                event entry, with the exception of junior karts. SCCA members must present a valid and current
                SCCA membership cardif asked to verify their membership.
                Non-SCCA members must complete a weekend membership form to be allowed to participate.
              </p>

              <h4><strong>Tech Inspection</strong></h4>
              <p>
                All vehicles participating in the event must pass a technical inspection prior to the drivers meeting.
                To enter the tech inspection area, a vehicle must be &quot;ready to run&quot;, meaning all loose items must be out of the passenger compartment and trunk (including floor mats), lug nuts tightened, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, the vehicle must have no obvious safety problems, such as a loose battery, brake lines dragging underneath the car, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a tech inspector deems a vehicle not ready for inspection, that vehicle must 
                be removed from the Tech Inspection area until it is ready.
              </p>

              <h4><strong>Helmets</strong></h4>
              <p>
                All competitors must either provide a helmet conforming to the current SCCA rules when presenting their vehicle for 
                Technical Inspection, or agree to use one of the AZBR's loaner helmets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Loaner helmets are available at the timing trailer between run groups. If you own a helmet, we may provide an AZBR sticker for helmets that pass inspection to save time at future events.
              </p>
              <h4><strong>Passengers</strong></h4>
              <p>
                Competitors may take passengers at their discretion. All passengers are required to wear a helmet conforming to SCCA rules, and must have already taken their competition runs, if any. If the members of a class agree, exceptions may be made to the competition run requirement, for example: to allow a Novice driver to ride as a passenger before or during their competition runs. All passengers must keep their hands, limbs and head completely inside the vehicle at all times.
               </p>
               <h4><strong>Kary Safety</strong></h4>
               <p>
                When karts are competing in an event, all other vehicles will be stopped while the karts are on course and in transit to and from the start and finish areas.&nbsp; When possible, karts will all run in the same run group, usually at the front of that group.
              </p>

              <h4><strong>Grid &amp; Paddock Speed Limit</strong></h4>
              <p>
                The speed limit in the pit and grid areas is 5mph. Burnouts and any other unsafe driving is not allowed.
                Anyone driving in an unsafe manner will be asked to leave the event.
              </p>

              <h4><strong>Run/Work Format</strong></h4>
              <p>
                All events are a work/run format. All competitors must be available to work one run group for each group in 
                which they run. This includes Time Only runs. The Chief of Workers will provide work assignments at each event, prior to the start of each group. Any competitor not reporting for work will have their runs disqualified, and no results will be posted. Multiple absences will result in that competitor being banned from future events.
              </p>
          
              <h4><strong>Scoring &amp; Points</strong></h4>
              <p>
                Each cone knocked over or out of place is a 2-second penalty.
                A deviation from the course will result in the run being scored as a DNF.
                Results for the event and the current Series will be determined by competitor's PAX time in their respective class.
                Novice and Street categories are treated as a single class for this 
                purpose, with each competitor's score based on the vehicle's appropriate PAX class.
              </p>

              <h4><strong>Refunds</strong></h4>
              <p>
                Should you choose to leave an event once paid/registered on site our policy on refunds is to provide credit. Be sure to request a credit record from one of the event organizers before you leave. This applies to competition and time only charges. Once you have made a run during a competition run group or time only run group credit will not be given. Examples of when a credit will be granted are: you have an emergency which requires you to leave prior to starting a competition or time only run group; your car does not pass inspection; or your car has a technical problem and cannot make it to grid for the first run.
              </p>
              <p>
                Credits are valid for one year from the date of the credit. Redemption of credit can be made at future events. It's your responsibility to keep track of your credit.
