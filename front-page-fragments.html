                      Spring has sprung and while the rest of the country is trying to figure out why they still use daylight savings, it is time to wake your awesome from hibernation and haul it out to Tucson.

                      Just a couple weekends before the SCCA's Championship and Pro Solo Tours make their
                      first west coast stops, AZBR is hosting another two day, tour-style autocross extravagana
                      at the Marana Regional Airport <strong>March 22nd and 23rd</strong>. As with the previous
                      Awesome Series we have run, you can sign up for just Saturday, just Sunday, or - if you're
                      awesome enough - both days. Registering <em>and paying</em> for both days by the close of on site registration on Saturday will get you $10 off your autocross weekend.
                      Online registration for both days opens Wednesday, March 12 at 7:00pm and closes on Thursday, March 20 at 5:00pm.
