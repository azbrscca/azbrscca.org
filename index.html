                      Just a couple weekends before the SCCA's Championship and Pro Solo Tours make their
                      first west coast stops, AZBR is hosting another two day, tour-style autocross extravagana
                      at the Marana Regional Airport <strong>March 22nd and 23rd</strong>. As with the previous
                      Awesome Series we have run, you can sign up for just Saturday, just Sunday, or - if you're
                      awesome enough - both days. Registering <em>and paying</em> for both days by the close of on site registration on Saturday will get you $10 off your autocross weekend.
                      Online registration for both days opens Wednesday, March 12 at 7:00pm and closes on Thursday, March 20 at 5:00pm.
