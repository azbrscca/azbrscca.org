                      For the third year running, the Arizona Border Region will be hosting a Tire Rack Street Survival school this fall. This year the school will take place on <strong>Saturday, November 1st</strong> at our usual autocross site, <strong>Marana Regional Airport</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      What is Street Survival? It is a national driver education program aimed at teaching teens the skills they need to improve their competence as drivers. The goal of the one day class is for students to better understand how their actions govern a carâ€™s responses, and as a result to become safer, more effective drivers on the road.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      How's it done? Students are paired with an experienced instructor and participate in both classroom style learning and "hands-on" driving experience in real-world situations. We use the students own car to teach then about how it reacts and how they can control it in an emergency and stay safe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Cost for the school is $75 and it will run from 8:30am to approximately 3:30pm on Saturday, November 1st.
