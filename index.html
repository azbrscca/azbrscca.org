                    <p>On November 11th, the Arizona Border Region will host a Tire Rack Street Survival school at Marana Regional Airport.</p>
                    <p>The primary emphasis of the Tire Rack Street SurvivalÂ® is a "hands-on" driving experience in real-world situations! We use your own car to teach you about its handling limits and how you can control them. The students will become more observant of the traffic situation they find themselves in. They will learn to look far enough ahead to anticipate unwise actions of other drivers. As the students master the application of physics to drive their cars, they will make fewer unwise driving actions themselves. They will understand why they should always wear their own seatbelts, and why they should insist that their passengers wear seatbelts, too.</p>
