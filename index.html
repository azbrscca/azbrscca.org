              <p>
                We are excited to announce our next event on September 27 at the Musselman Honda Circuit. Due to
                COVID-19 we have not run an event since March both from a safety perspective and the Marana Airport
                site has been turned into a commercial airplane parking lot. We are now ready to run a COVID-19 safe
                event with appropriate precautions and cooperation from all of us. There are new rules for this site
                that also include the expectations for operating with COVID-19. See link below and on the registration
                page. Registration is now open and participation will be limited to 50 drivers on a first come basis.
                No guests or non-participants are allowed...drivers only...others will be turned away. The cost of
                entry has been increased $5 and the Paypal fee has been waved. Be sure to register early if you want to
                get in on the action...

                The SCCA Foundation is sponsoring VETMotorsports to provide more
                opportunities for veterans to participate at competitive events.
                Assisted by local volunteers, the veterans are given the
                opportunity to drive, work with the pit crew and ride-along in
                both four wheel and two wheel events.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our Region has proudly supported this program since 2018 by
                providing ride-alongs at Solo events. The ultimate goal is to place veterans in
                hands-on, high stress, team environments reflecting the
                environment of active duty assignments. By associating these
                feelings with a positive, fun activity, we hope to help them
                heal and move forward. You can find more information at the web
                site below.
