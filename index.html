                <p>
                  Arizona Border Region is offering two Evolution Driving Schools for 2019. If you are interested in becoming a better driver, 
                  getting a leg up on the competition, or improving your skills to move up to national competition, these schools provide what 
                  you are seeking!
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Phase One school is on February 16th and offers training to all drivers from complete novices to seasoned veterans. The 
                  Phase One school features 24 runs with a team of championship caliber instructors, and each student will work with two different 
                  instructors throughout the day.
                </p>
                  The Phase Two school is on March 16th and offers additional skill sets for anyone who has taken Phase One. This Phase Two school 
                  features 24 runs on four different course configurations, and all with a team of championship caliber instructors. Again each 
                  student will work with two different instructors throughout the day. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The cost for each school is $275 per day. We believe these schools offer YOU the best bang for your buck when compared to 
                  spending money on aftermarket car modifications. Better DRIVER = faster TIMES!

                The SCCA Foundation is sponsoring VETMotorsports to provide more
                opportunities for veterans to participate at competitive events.
                Assisted by local volunteers, the veterans are given the
                opportunity to drive, work with the pit crew and ride-along in
                both four wheel and two wheel events.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our Region has proudly supported this program since 2018 by
                providing ride-alongs at Solo events. The ultimate goal is to place veterans in
                hands-on, high stress, team environments reflecting the
                environment of active duty assignments. By associating these
                feelings with a positive, fun activity, we hope to help them
                heal and move forward. You can find more information at the web
                site below.
